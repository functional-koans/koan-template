# koan-template

A Leiningen template for standalone koan projects based on the [Clojure Koan Engine](https://github.com/functional-koans/clojure-koan-engine).

## Usage

Add the needed plugins to your `~/.lein/profile.clj` file

    {:user {:plugins [[koan-template "0.1.3"]]}}

Now you can create a new project using the leiningen template:

    lein new koan <your-project-name>
    cd <your-project-name>
    chmod +x script/*

Run `lein koan run` to see the included example koan. The README of the resulting project will contain everything your users need to know to run the koans.

## Customizing your new project

All new projects will require the following steps:

- add custom dependencies to `project.clj`. (Clojure defaults to 1.3.0, but feel free to roll back to 1.2.1 if your library needs it.)
- Delete the example koan at `src/koans/example_koan.clj` (or add to it!)
- Add APIs and other namespaces to the Dojo, as discussed on the [dojo wiki page](https://github.com/functional-koans/clojure-koan-engine/wiki/The-Dojo).
- Write some more koans using the instructions at the [koan-engine github page](https://github.com/functional-koans/clojure-koan-engine/wiki/How-to-write-koans).
- Add proper solutions to `resources/koans.clj`
- Customize `README.md`

And that's it! The template handles all structure, leaving you to craft puzzles and delight users. Once you've got `lein koan test` passing again, make your code available to the world and await your students.

## Standalone Distribution

koan-template includes the `lein-koan` plugin by default, as this tends to be the most familiar way for users to get up and running. If you're interested in reaching users without leiningen (as with [clojure-koans](https://github.com/functional-koans/clojure-koans)), it can make sense to bundle a release version by running

    script/bundle.sh

This command creates a zipfile with all dependencies suitable for standalone distribution. The following scripts are included in the template for non-leiningen users on Mac/\*nix:

    script/run
    script/test
    script/repl

And on Windows:

    script\run
    script\test
    script\repl
